This repository is where the mocked admin site is hosted. admin-spa holds the development version of the admin mock application seen at [mattcheah.com](http://mattcheah.com).
This is written in Angular and had all API requests removed and replaced with mocked data stored in JSON files. 
As such, some of the features of the admin dashboard do not work as planned in the mocked version, but one can see a fairly good representation of what the dashboard is meant to look like. [(See it here)](http://mattcheah.com/admin-mock)
